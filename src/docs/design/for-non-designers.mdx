# Design Training for Non-designers

Design is a critical part of product development, and there’s no substitute for having a dedicated designer embedded with the product team. That said, every team member can benefit from acquiring design skills — engineers can better understand the product benefit and design intent.

Listed below are some recommended design courses for non-designers. Most of these courses are behind a paywall, but they offer a better learning experience compared to reading materials.

# User Experience Design

User experience (UX) design involves a broad spectrum of expertise, from market research to design thinking. It is a critical skill for anyone on a front-end team who is expected to conceptualize new features from scratch.

The UX training is better conducted in person with an experienced instructor. You may also rely on online resources to help you deepen your understanding of the domain.

# User Interface Design

The user interface (UI) design deals with visual designs — the most efficient way to present a piece of information. It is a good skill to have for team members who need to improvise to incorporate a small feature into an established UI.
