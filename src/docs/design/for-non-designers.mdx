# Design Training for Non-designers

Design is a critical part of product development, and there’s no substitute for having a dedicated designer embedded with the product team. That said, every team member (including engineers and managers) can benefit from acquiring design skills. Improving your understanding of design principles will improve your ability to communicate with designers, ask thoughtful questions about designs, understand design intent, and more.

Notice how the second design considered both aesthetics and what matters to users the most. Learning more about design will improve the quality of your products, even if you don't have a dedicated designer.`}

Listed below are some recommended design courses for non-designers. Most of these courses require a paid subscription, but the best content often does. These courses offer a much more robust learning experience compared to free materials / articles that you might find elsewhere.

# User Experience Design

User experience (UX) design covers a broad spectrum of topics, from market research to design thinking. The key focus here is understanding the problem you are trying to solve and ensuring that you solve it in the right way. It is a critical skill for anyone on a front-end team, especially if you will be responsible for envisioning new concepts / features.

The UX training is better conducted in person with an experienced instructor. You may also rely on online resources to help you deepen your understanding of the domain.

# User Interface Design

User interface (UI) design deals with the visual side of design — how will you best present a piece of information on the screen. It is a good skill to have for team members who may need to improvise or incorporate small features into an established UI.
