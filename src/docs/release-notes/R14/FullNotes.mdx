### Component Library

We have been continuing to develop new components to build out our component library.

-   For React Native, we have added components for [Header](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/react-native-component-library/blob/dev/docs/Header.md), [InfoListItem](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/react-native-component-library/blob/dev/docs/InfoListItem.md), and [ScoreCard](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/react-native-component-library/blob/dev/docs/ScoreCard.md).
-   For React, we have added components for [InfoListItem](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/react/components/info-list-item) and [ScoreCard](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/react/components/score-card).

### Moving to TypeScript

To take advantage of it's many benefits, new resources for React and React Native will be built using Typescript instead of plain JavaScript. We have also begun the process of migrating our existing resources to TypeScript.
