-   Rearchitected from the ground up for greater control and customization
    -    Screens are all exported individually as independent components
    -    Screen customizations available through screen components
    -    Declarative syntax for building custom flows / reordering screens / adding or removing screens
    -    Router independence (react-navigation still recommended)
    -    Simplified internationalization giving users more control over translations
    -    Additional actions for more back-end integrations
    -    More robust error management solution
    -    Dependencies updated to support the latest third-party versions
