## React Native

-   The React Native Registration Workflow was re-architected to allow for greater flexibility from the application side with several more Registration UI Actions such as:
    -   acceptEula
    -   requestRegistrationCode
    -   validateUserRegistrationRequest
    -   createPassword
    -   completeRegistration
-   The new major version with breaking changes also provides greater control over your routing library, internationalization, screen order/custom screens, error handling, etc.
-   We are currently in the process of migrating our React Native Authentication Workflow.
