## Innersource 2.0

-   Explored the possibility of establishing an innersource portal for viewing all ongoing projects at Eaton. Based on the results of the MVP, we decided to scale the approach down and start smaller with a dedicated community packages space.

## React

-   Updated react auth worklow package to componentize, export screens individually to allow for better custom screen ordering and injection, support React Router v6 and router customizability and support for the latest versions of i18next and react-i18next packages.

-   @brightlayer-ui/react-auth-workflow v4.0.0 ([Changelog](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-react-workflows/blob/master/login-workflow/CHANGELOG.md))
